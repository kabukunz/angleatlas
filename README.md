Atlas
===

This is a C++ implementation of the robust atlas generation method in the following paper:

[Chi Zhang], [Mao-Feng Xu], [Shuangming Chai](https://kfckfckf.github.io/), and [Xiao-Ming Fu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~fuxm).
Robust Atlas Generation via Angle-based Segmentation.
Computer-Aided Geometric Design (GMP), 2020. 

The code is written by Chi Zhang & Mao-Feng Xu using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.

The file called "SplitPolygon.zip" contains the part of the code that split polygons, and The file named "AtlasGeneration.zip" contains the rest of the code.
the latter code can run if other necessary libraries are included since it contains the exe file generated by the former code.
